    <p class="p0"> I encountered many difficulties during the production process. I initially planned to create an overall interface that combined music and video, but I found that the web page created in this way was very monotonous. Minimalism is not just monotonous and practical. The way of dealing with white space is a big challenge for me. So, I chose two videos and two music for special classification to complete my web page. After this assignment, I found that I have a new understanding of web page production. The spacing and classification between elements are very important for web pages. It is necessary to achieve practicality while also taking into account the aesthetics of the web page.</p>
    <p class="p3">This is the definition of Minimalist web page：</p>
    <p class="p2">1. Minimalist visual elements</p>
    <p class="p1">Minimalist designs typically feature a small amount of color, simple graphics, and refined typography. The color selection should be limited, generally no more than three. Use neutral tones as the main colors, supplemented by a small amount of bright color embellishments to guide the user's attention. Graphics and icons should be concise and clear, avoiding complicated details.</p>
    <p class="p2">2. Clear layout</p>
    <p class="p1">Font selection should be simple and easy to read. Text should have adequate line and paragraph spacing to ensure legibility and visual comfort. The clear hierarchy of titles, main text, and auxiliary text helps users quickly grab important information.</p>
    <p class="p2">3. Reasonable white space</p>
    <p class="p1">White space is the key to minimalist design. By increasing the white space between elements, you can improve the readability of content and reduce the visual burden on users. White space is more than just a background; it plays a role in design to organize content, guide the user’s eye, and create visual breathing space.</p>
    <p class="p2">4. Simple navigation</p>
    <p class="p1">Navigation design should be concise and concise, usually in the form of a top or sidebar, and the number of menu items should be kept to a minimum. The navigation bar should remain visible at all times so that users can find what they are looking for without having to click too much.</p>
    <p class="p2">5. Focus on content</p>
    <p class="p1">The core of minimalist design is that content is king. Each page should focus on one main goal and avoid unnecessary elements that distract users. Images and videos should be carefully selected to ensure they are relevant and of high quality. Text content should be concise and clear, avoiding lengthy descriptions.</p>
    <p class="p2">6. Interactivity and usability</p>
    <p class="p1">Although minimalist design pursues simplicity, it does not ignore interactivity. Buttons and links should be obvious and provide clear feedback to help users understand the status of the interaction. The design should take into account the compatibility of different devices and browsers, ensuring a responsive design and providing a consistent user experience.</p>
